# HLAT Dataset
This is the HLAT Dataset proposed in paper Exploring Human-like Attention Supervision in Visual Question Answering[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06308), which has been accepted by AAAI-2018. 

In this work, we propose a Human Attention Network (HAN) to predict the attention map for a given image-question pair.

There are some examples that generated by the HAN.

We improve the performance of attention-based VQA models by adding human-like attention supervision.

Here shows the examples of the comparison of "Before and After Supervision"

Our method shows good performance in improving the accuracy of VQA, especially in counting problem, e.g.How many candles are on the table?

Here we provide the .h5 file of attention maps for both the VQA1.0 and the VQA2.0 dataset.
Using our attention maps to improve the performance of VQA is quite easy. 
We did it through adding the attention supervision to the attention-based model.

The .h5 file of attention maps can be found here:


The .h5 file format has the following data structure: 
{
"pre_attmap" : attention maps for all question id 
}
Which means that in each .h5 file, there is only one dict, whose key is named as "pre_attmap". The order of the attention maps is as same as the order of the question ids in the file. Therefore it is easy to get the attention maps for the question-image pairs if you know the order of the question id in the .json file provided by the [VQA official webset](http://visualqa.org/download.html)

For more details, please refer to our paper: 

For VQA1.0 dataset, there are:
369,861 attention maps for questions in the trainval set 
244,302 attention maps for questions in the testing set
 60,864 attention maps for questions in the test-dev set

For VQA2.0 dataset, there are:
658,111 attention maps for questions in the trainval set 
447,793 attention maps for questions in the testing set
107,394 attention maps for questions in the test-dev set
